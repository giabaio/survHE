#' Engine for Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis on the survival curves
#' 
#' Creates the survival curves for the fitted model(s)
#' 
#' 
#' @param fit the result of the call to the \code{fit.models} function,
#' containing the model fitting (and other relevant information)
#' @param mod the index of the model. Default value is 1, but the user can
#' choose which model fit to visualise, if the call to fit.models has a vector
#' argument for distr (so many models are fitted & stored in the same object)
#' @param t the time vector to be used for the estimation of the survival curve
#' @param newdata a list (of lists), specifiying the values of the covariates
#' at which the computation is performed. For example
#' \code{list(list(arm=0),list(arm=1))} will create two survival curves, one
#' obtained by setting the covariate \code{arm} to the value 0 and the other by
#' setting it to the value 1. In line with \code{flexsurv} notation, the user
#' needs to either specify the value for *all* the covariates or for none (in
#' which case, \code{newdata=NULL}, which is the default). If some value is
#' specified and at least one of the covariates is continuous, then a single
#' survival curve will be computed in correspondence of the average values of
#' all the covariates (including the factors, which in this case are expanded
#' into indicators).
#' @param nsim The number of simulations from the distribution of the survival
#' curves. Default at \code{nsim=1}, in which case uses the point estimate for
#' the relevant distributional parameters and computes the resulting survival
#' curve
#' @param ...  Additional options
