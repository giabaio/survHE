Description: Contains a suite of functions for survival analysis in health economics.
    These can be used to run survival models under a frequentist (based on maximum likelihood)
    or a Bayesian approach (both based on Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation or Hamiltonian
    Monte Carlo). The user can specify a set of parametric models using a common notation and
    select the preferred mode of inference. The results can also be post-processed to produce
    probabilistic sensitivity analysis and can be used to export the output to an Excel
    file (e.g. for a Markov model, as often done by modellers and practitioners). <doi:10.18637/jss.v095.i14>.
