\title{Create an individual level dataset from digitised data}
\usage{
make.ipd(ipd_files, ctr = 1, var.labs = c("time", "event", "arm"))
}
\arguments{
\item{ipd_files}{a list including the names of the IPD files created as
output of digitise}

\item{ctr}{the index of the file associated with the control arm (default,
the first file). This will be coded as 0}

\item{var.labs}{a vector of labels for the column of the resulting data
matrix. NB these should match the arguments to the formula specified for
fit.models. The user can specify values. These should be 4 elements (ID,
TIME, EVENT, ARM)}
}
\description{
Piles in the simulated IPD resulting from running digitise for more than one
treatment arm
}
\examples{

# Defines the txt files to be used as inputs
surv.inp <- system.file("extdata", "survival.txt", package = "survHE")
nrisk.inp <- system.file("extdata", "nrisk.txt", package = "survHE")
# Runs 'digitise' to create the relevant output files
digitise(surv.inp, nrisk.inp, ipd_output = "IPD.txt")
# Now uses 'make.ipd' to create the pseudo-data
make.ipd("IPD.txt", ctr = 1, var.labs = c("time", "event", "arm"))
